      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\ngreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\ntoo far off.\nI could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\nPurvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.\n”\n\nHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\nservants remained.\nBut when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\nBennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\ndaughter, let us come to a right understanding.\nInto _one_ house in this\nneighbourhood they shall never have admittance.\nI will not encourage the\nimprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.\n”\n\nA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr.\nBennet was firm: it\nsoon led to another; and Mrs.\nBennet found, with amazement and horror,\nthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\ndaughter.\nHe protested that she should receive from him no mark of\naffection whatever on the occasion.\nMrs.\nBennet could hardly comprehend\nit.\nThat his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\nresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\nmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\npossible.\nShe was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\nclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\nshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\ntook place.\nElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\nthe moment, been led to make Mr.\nDarcy acquainted with their fears for\nher sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\ntermination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\nunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\nspot.\nShe had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nBingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\nactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\nas Mr.\nBingley was incomprehensible.\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself.\nOf neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.\n“How despicably have I acted!\n” she cried.\n“I, who have prided myself on\nmy discernment!\nI, who have valued myself on my abilities!\nwho have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust.\nHow humiliating is this\ndiscovery!\nYet, how just a humiliation!\nHad I been in love, I could not\nhave been more wretchedly blind.\nBut vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly.\nPleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\nconcerned.\nTill this moment, I never knew myself.\n”\n\nFrom herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr.\nDarcy’s explanation\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.\nWidely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr.\nDarcy changed colour; but the emotion\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\ncontinued,--\n\n“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.\nNo motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.\nYou dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\nkind.\n”\n\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n“Can you deny that you have done it?\n” she repeated.\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success.\nTowards _him_ I have been\nkinder than towards myself.\n”\n\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\nis founded.\nLong before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided.\nYour character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr.\nWickham.\nOn this subject, what can you have to\nsay?\nIn what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\n”\n\n“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\ninterest in him?\n”\n\n“His misfortunes!\n” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.\nWhile\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.\nHad Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\nthat corps.\nNot a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s\nmeditated elopement.\nTo no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own.\nHe had certainly formed such a plan; and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nDarcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.\n“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\ndisappointment.\n”\n\n“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\n”\n\n“Blame you!\nOh, no.\n”\n\n“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\n”\n\n“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\n”\n\n“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.\n”\n\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham.\nWhat a stroke was this for poor Jane,\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\ncollected in one individual!\nNor was Darcy’s vindication, though\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.\n“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\nof them good for anything.\nTake your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one.\nThere is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\nabout pretty much.\nFor my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\nDarcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.\n”\n\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.\n“Wickham so\nvery bad!\nIt is almost past belief.\nAnd poor Mr.\nDarcy!\ndear Lizzy,\nonly consider what he must have suffered.\nSuch a disappointment!",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth.\nShe directly replied,--\n\n“You need not be frightened.\nI never heard any harm of her; and I dare\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\nShe is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.\nHurst and\nMiss Bingley.\nI think I have heard you say that you know them.\n”\n\n“I know them a little.\nTheir brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.\n”\n\n“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr.\nDarcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\n”\n\n“Care of him!\nYes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care.\nFrom something that he told me\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\nto him.\nBut I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\nthat Bingley was the person meant.\nIt was all conjecture.\n”\n\n“What is it you mean?\n”\n\n“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\n”\n\n“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\n”\n\n“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley.\nWhat he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\n”\n\n“Did Mr.\nDarcy give you his reasons for this interference?\n”\n\n“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\nlady.\n”\n\n“And what arts did he use to separate them?",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it.\nDid you see it?\n”\n\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\nElizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes.\nHow Mr.\nDarcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.\n“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”\ncontinued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr.\nBingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me.\nThey are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long.\nHis regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven!\nhe has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.\n”\n\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr.\nDarcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat.\nIt drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present.\nA few weeks, he believed.\n“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr.\nBingley,” said her mother,\n“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet’s manor.\nI am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.\n”\n\nElizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention!\nWere the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\nAt that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\nin company with either of them.\nTheir society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this!\nLet me never see either\none or the other again!",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nNo sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room.\nIn no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr.\nDarcy were by no means over.\nMiss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.\nMiss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\n”\n\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.\nWhile\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes."

      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place.\nWith astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\nSince her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy.\nShe found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful.\nShe was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle.\nElizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr.\nDarcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\nThey had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.\nAll\nElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.\nHe\ninquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\nlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\nTo Mr.\nand Mrs.\nGardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself.\nThey had long wished to see him.\nThe whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention.\nThe suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nNo sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room.\nIn no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr.\nDarcy were by no means over.\nMiss Darcy, on her brother’s\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.\nMiss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\n”\n\nIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.\nWhile\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.\nBennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the\ngood-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,\nhad revived.\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time.\nWhen they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister.\nHer prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself.\nOn entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided.\nHe placed himself by her.\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\nHe\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr.\nDarcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured.\nThough she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.\nIt\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour.\nMr.\nDarcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them.\nHe was on one side of her mother.\nShe knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage.\nShe was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more.\nHer brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\nmentioned; and while Mr.\nDarcy was attending them to their carriage,\nMiss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s\nperson, behaviour, and dress.\nBut Georgiana would not join her.\nHer\nbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment\ncould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave\nGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and\namiable.\nWhen Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr.\nDarcy,” she cried: “I\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse!\nLouisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.\n”\n\nHowever little Mr.\nDarcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her.\nHer face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.\nHer nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines.\nHer teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\nextraordinary in them.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nYou know how I detest it, unless I am\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.\nAt such an assembly as this, it\nwould be insupportable.\nYour sisters are engaged, and there is not\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\nstand up with.\n”\n\n“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a\nkingdom!\nUpon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my\nlife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,\nuncommonly pretty.\n”\n\n“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!\nBut there is one\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\ndare say very agreeable.\nDo let me ask my partner to introduce you.\n”\n\n[Illustration:\n\n“She is tolerable”\n\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen.\n_]]\n\n“Which do you mean?\n” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\nElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,\n“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\nby other men.\nYou had better return to your partner and enjoy her\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\n”\n\nMr.\nBingley followed his advice.\nMr.\nDarcy walked off; and Elizabeth\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him.\nShe told the story,\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\nMrs.\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\nparty.\nMr.\nBingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\ndistinguished by his sisters.\nJane was as much gratified by this as her\nmother could be, though in a quieter way.\nElizabeth felt Jane’s\npleasure.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister as the servant was approaching the door.\nJane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.\nOn the\ngentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.\nShe\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy.\nHe looked serious as usual; and,\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley.\nBut, perhaps, he could not in her\nmother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.\nIt was a\npainful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\nBingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.\nHe was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher courtesy and address of his friend.\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.\nDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr.\nand Mrs.\nGardiner did--a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything.\nHe\nwas not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\nit had not been so in Derbyshire.\nThere he had talked to her friends\nwhen he could not to herself.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nDenny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr.\nWickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps.\nThis was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming.\nHis appearance was\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\nThe introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street.\nOn distinguishing the ladies of the group\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities.\nBingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object.\nHe was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her.\nMr.\nDarcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\nBoth changed colour,\none looked white, the other red.\nMr.\nWickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr.\nDarcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it?\nIt was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.\nIn another minute Mr.\nBingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\nMr.\nDenny and Mr.\nWickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\nMr.\nPhilips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.",

      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\n”\n\n“Oh, yes!\nBe so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.\nSay that\nurgent business calls us home immediately.\nConceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible.\nI know it cannot be long.\n”\n\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\nonly one serious parting look, went away.\nAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.\nBut if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment.\nBe that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness.\nNever since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a\nhope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her.\nNo one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nBut, my\n     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\n     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\n     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\nI do not at\n     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\n     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\n     be deceived again.\nCaroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\n     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.\nWhen she\n     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\n     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\n     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\n     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\n     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.\nI pity, though I\n     cannot help blaming, her.\nShe was very wrong in singling me out as\n     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\n     her side.\nBut I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\n     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\n     brother is the cause of it.\nI need not explain myself farther; and\n     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\n     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\n     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\n     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.\nI cannot but wonder,\n     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\n     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.\nHe knows of my\n     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\n     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\n     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.\nI cannot\n     understand it.\nIf I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\n     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\n     duplicity in all this.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nThe respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced.\nBut above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\noverlooked.\nIt was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection.\nHe who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.\nSuch\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\nShe respected,\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nHer many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter.\nShe wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an\ninmate of Mr.\nDarcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation.\nHer heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister and resentment against all others.\nTo Caroline’s\nassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit.\nThat he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations.\nHad his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself.\nIt was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.\nShe\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;\nwhether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\nA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs."

      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nBennet, with more perseverance than\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--\n\n“Good Lord!\nSir William, how can you tell such a story?\nDo not you know\nthat Mr.\nCollins wants to marry Lizzy?\n”\n\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr.\nCollins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs.\nBennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent.\nIn the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.\nCollins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off.\nTwo\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.\nNothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her.\nNor did that day wear out her\nresentment.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nI am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\nshe can have no objection.\nCome, Kitty, I want you upstairs.\n” And\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\ncalled out,--\n\n“Dear ma’am, do not go.\nI beg you will not go.\nMr.\nCollins must excuse\nme.\nHe can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.\nI am\ngoing away myself.\n”\n\n“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.\nI desire you will stay where you are.\n” And\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\nMr.\nCollins.\n”\n\nElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\nbetween distress and diversion.\nMrs.\nBennet and Kitty walked off, and as\nsoon as they were gone, Mr.\nCollins began,--\n\n“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.\nYou\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother’s permission for this address.\nYou can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.\nAlmost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life.\nBut before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\n”\n\nThe idea of Mr.",
      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\n”\n\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.\n“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair.\n_You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\n_I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.\nDo not be\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will.\nYou need not.\nThere are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.\nThe more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense.\nI have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\nthe other is Charlotte’s marriage.\nIt is unaccountable!\nin every view it\nis unaccountable!\n”\n\n“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.\nThey will\nruin your happiness.\nYou do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper.\nConsider Mr.\nCollins’s respectability, and\nCharlotte’s prudent, steady character.\nRemember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\n”\n\n“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart.\nMy dear Jane, Mr.\nCollins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking.\nYou shall not defend her, though\nit is Charlotte Lucas.",

      "#pride_and_Prejudice#pride_and_Prejudice\nPerhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\npositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\nhave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\nblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\nYou will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\nfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\ndaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr.\nBennet the\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\nMy conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\ndismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\nliable to error.\nI have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\nMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.\n”\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n[Illustration]\n\nThe discussion of Mr.\nCollins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\nAs for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\nby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\nstiffness of manner and resentful silence.\nHe scarcely ever spoke to\nher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\nespecially to her friend.\nThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.\nBennet’s ill humour or ill\nhealth.\nMr.\nCollins was also in the same state of angry pride.\nElizabeth\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\nnot appear in the least affected by it.\nHe was always to have gone on\nSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.",

    "\"Minuteness of touch\" in the context of literary qualities refers to the subtle and precise attention to detail that an author employs in their writing. It involves an ability to convey intricate nuances and small details that contribute to the richness and realism of the narrative. This quality is exemplified in Jane Austen's work, where her humor and characterizations are crafted with extreme finesse and subtlety. Austen's style is marked by a delicate and understated approach that captures the complexities of human behavior and social interactions, building vivid, lifelike characters and settings. This meticulousness ensures that her narratives are deeply engaging and authentic.",

    "Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy initially viewed Elizabeth Bennet with disdain and indifference, respectively. Miss Bingley harbored feelings of disdain and jealousy towards Elizabeth, often critiquing her appearance and manners in a sharp and dismissive manner. She made disparaging remarks about Elizabeth's nose, teeth, and eyes in an attempt to undermine her appeal in Darcy's eyes. On the other hand, Mr. Darcy initially viewed Elizabeth with indifference, describing her as \"tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.\" His first impression was influenced by his reluctance to engage with women overlooked by other men.",
    "Mrs. Bennet is keen on Jane marrying the wealthy neighbor, Mr. Bingley, because it offers numerous advantages for her family. First, Mr. Bingley is charming and affluent, making him an ideal match for Jane. Mrs. Bennet sees this marriage as strategically important for the family's future prospects. The proximity of Mr. Bingley's residence, merely three miles away, is a source of self-gratulation for Mrs. Bennet. Additionally, she believes that Mr. Bingley's sisters are fond of Jane, which reassures her that they would desire the marriage as much as she does. Furthermore, Jane's marriage to a wealthy man would benefit her younger daughters by placing them in the company of other affluent men, thereby increasing their chances of making advantageous marriages themselves. Lastly, Mrs. Bennet finds comfort in the idea that she could rely on Jane to care for her single sisters, which would grant her the freedom to avoid social engagements. Overall, the marriage promises personal happiness for Jane and significant strategic and social benefits for the entire family.",

Their conversations, marked by a blend of formality and underlying emotion, reflect the intricate dynamics of social expectations and personal feelings. The narrative hints at a shared past between them, revealing unspoken tensions and mutual understanding that suggest a deep connection beyond their outward interactions. This complexity is heightened by the societal norms they must navigate, which require a careful dance of words and actions. As they interact within these constraints, the true nature of their relationship is gradually unveiled, adding richness to the story and inviting readers to look beyond the surface to fully grasp their bond.",

    "Darcy's early rudeness profoundly impacts both his proposal to Elizabeth Bennet and their later interactions. Initially, Elizabeth perceives Darcy's manners as arrogant and conceited, which forms a strong foundation for her disapproval of him. This disdain is cemented by Darcy's dismissive attitude and prideful nature, leading Elizabeth to develop an \"immovable dislike\" for him. When Darcy proposes, he does so in a manner that underscores these negative traits, expressing his affection almost begrudgingly and with an apparent disregard for Elizabeth's feelings. He acknowledges the disparity in their social standings, which only serves to offend Elizabeth further. Her response is one of anger and rejection, emphasizing her perception of his arrogance and selfishness. This initial rudeness and the manner of his proposal create an environment of tension and misunderstanding between them, which Darcy struggles to overcome in their later interactions. Despite his genuine feelings, Elizabeth's opinion of him remains tainted by his earlier behavior, highlighting the importance of first impressions and manners in shaping relationships.",
    "A parish rector, such as Mr. Collins, must balance personal ambitions and home improvement projects with duties to the community and the expectations of his patroness, in this case, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. This involves aligning personal preferences and projects, like home improvements, with the approval of the patroness while also fulfilling his responsibilities as a clergyman to foster peace and harmony within the parish.",
    "Lady Catherine expects Elizabeth to refrain from interfering with the intended marriage between Mr. Darcy and her daughter, Miss Anne de Bourgh. She regards the union as a natural and necessary alliance between two prestigious families and perceives Elizabeth as a threat to this plan. Lady Catherine is determined to ensure that Elizabeth understands her place and does not take any actions that might jeopardize the engagement.",
    "Miss Bingley might watch Mr. Darcy's reading habits as his view of Elizabeth changes because she is trying to capture his attention and favor. Her observation of his habits, including his reading, is a calculated attempt to align herself with his interests and understand what draws him to Elizabeth. As Darcy's admiration for Elizabeth grows, Miss Bingley, who is interested in Darcy herself, might feel jealous and wants to find a way to reclaim his interest or comprehend the dynamics between Darcy and Elizabeth better.",
    "Mrs. Bennet's hopes for her daughter Jane's marriage are strategic and ambitious, focusing on securing advantageous social and financial connections. She wants Jane to marry Mr. Bingley, a wealthy young man, to not only ensure Jane's future but also to elevate the prospects of her other daughters by associating them with affluent circles. Additionally, Mrs. Bennet hopes that a well-married Jane could take on responsibilities for her unmarried sisters, thereby reducing Mrs. Bennet's own social obligations.\n\nIn contrast, Lady Lucas's contentment with her daughter Charlotte's marriage is more immediate and personal. It is rooted in the simple satisfaction of Charlotte being married before any of Mrs. Bennet's daughters, without any broader strategic ambitions. Lady Lucas's satisfaction lacks the extended ambitions and strategic considerations that motivate Mrs. Bennet's hopes for her family.",
    "Hiding feelings can have significant ramifications in a woman's love life. It can serve as a protective measure by shielding her from the impertinent suspicions of society. However, it also poses the risk of leaving her affections unnoticed by the object of her love. Being overly guarded with her emotions might inadvertently prevent her from securing the affections of the man she loves. Therefore, there is a delicate balance between maintaining modesty and providing enough encouragement to foster a romantic attachment. This balance is necessary to engage fully with the emotional dynamics that could lead to a lasting relationship.",

    "Darcy's pride significantly impacts his marriage proposal to Elizabeth Bennet in a negative way. His pride manifests in the manner and tone of his proposal, as he approaches Elizabeth with an air of superiority and emphasizes the disparity in their social standings. He is aware of the inferiority of Elizabeth's connections and struggles with the idea of forming an alliance with her, which betrays his pride. This approach offends Elizabeth, as she perceives his proposal as condescending rather than a genuine declaration of love. Consequently, his pride acts as a barrier to his intentions, leading to Elizabeth's rejection of his proposal.",
    "Mrs. Bennet sees Elizabeth's (Lizzy's) trait of being \"headstrong\" and \"foolish\" as the reason for rejecting Mr. Collins's marriage proposal. Mrs. Bennet believes that Elizabeth is behaving in a manner that is not in her own best interests and is determined to persuade her to change her mind."
