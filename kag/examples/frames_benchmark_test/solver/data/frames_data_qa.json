Here are the laureates and their specific contributions:  1. **Max Planck (1918)** - Planck is considered the father of quantum theory. He introduced the idea of energy quanta and derived Planck's radiation law, which describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium.     2. **Albert Einstein (1921)** - Although awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein made crucial contributions to quantum theory with his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of light.  3. **Niels Bohr (1922)** - Bohr received his Nobel Prize for his contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and radiation. His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",
