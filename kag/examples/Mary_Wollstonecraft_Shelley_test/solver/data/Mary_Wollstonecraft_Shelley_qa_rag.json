      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.\nMy\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\nday additional ideas.\nMy eyes became accustomed to the light and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.\nI found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it.\nIn my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.\nHow strange,\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!\nI\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood.\nI quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\nand would not burn.\nI was pained at this and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire.\nThe wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried and itself became inflamed.\nI reflected on this, and by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\nplentiful supply of fire.\nWhen night came on and brought sleep with\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.\nI\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\ninto sleep.\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nHe and his companion\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted.\nI never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair.\nMy protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world.\nFor the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death.\nWhen I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me.\nBut again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.\nAs\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.\nI lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched.\nA part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected.\nThe wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nI\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\ninto sleep.\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.\nI\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished.\nWhen night came again I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.\nI\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\nthe live embers.\nI found that the berries were spoiled by this\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\n“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.\nWhen\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\nmore easily satisfied.\nIn this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\nto reproduce it.\nI gave several hours to the serious consideration of\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\ntowards the setting sun.\nI passed three days in these rambles and at\nlength discovered the open country.\nA great fall of snow had taken\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\ndamp substance that covered the ground.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nMy father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.\nWealth was an\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\na violent death!\nNor were these my only visions.\nThe raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors.\nAnd thus for a time I was\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.\nIt\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.\nI remained,\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\nremained but a blasted stump.\nWhen we visited it the next morning, we found\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner.\nIt was not splintered by the\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.\nI never beheld\nanything so utterly destroyed.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nWhat did their tears imply?\nDid they\nreally express pain?\nI was at first unable to solve these questions,\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree.\nTheir nourishment\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\ncould scarcely procure food to support it.\nThey often, I believe,\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.\nI had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours.\nI found that the youth spent a great part of each day\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\npile of wood on the outside.\nShe uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise.\nI observed, with pleasure,\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\ncottage and cultivating the garden.\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment."

      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nDelighted and surprised, I embraced her,\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\ncreated.\nHe held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\nmay be called, were fixed on me.\nHis jaws opened, and he muttered some\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.\nHe might have\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.\nI took refuge in the\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\nhad so miserably given life.\nOh!\nNo mortal could support the horror of that countenance.\nA mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.\nI\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\nI passed the night wretchedly.\nSometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.\nMingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nYes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery.\nI thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.\nThe wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment.\nI was alone; none were near me to dissipate\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\nterrible reveries.\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon.\nA few fishing vessels alone\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another.\nI felt the silence,\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\nperson landed close to my house.\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly.\nI trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.\n’\n\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast.\nI took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.\nIn spite\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me.\nFor a few moments I\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\nexpressive of disgust and affright.\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?\nI only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.\nA woman was\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\nloveliness of youth and health.\nHere, I thought, is one of those whose\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.\nAnd then I bent over\nher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\nbeloved, awake!\n’\n\n“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.\nShould she\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?\nThus\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.",
      "#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley#Mary_Wollstonecraft_Shelley\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.\nThe next\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\nof my laboratory.\nThe remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\nmangled the living flesh of a human being.\nI paused to collect myself and\nthen entered the chamber.\nWith trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\nchemical apparatus.\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.\nI had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\nclearly.\nThe idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.\nI had resolved in\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore."

    "Safie's mother played a pivotal role in shaping Safie's beliefs and aspirations by instilling in her the values of her Christian faith, the importance of intellectual growth, and the desire for independence. Despite being made a slave by the Turks, Safie's mother maintained her dignity and taught Safie to aspire to intellectual and spiritual independence, which were typically denied to women in their culture. Her mother's disdain for the bondage she experienced left a lasting impression on Safie, inspiring her to seek a life of freedom and societal contribution rather than subjugation. Safie's mother's teachings encouraged her to envision a future where she could enjoy greater independence and social standing, ideally in a society that valued women and respected their rights. These ideals influenced Safie's decision to reject a life of subjugation and pursue a future where she could marry a Christian and live in a society that respected women's rights.",

    "A creator might seek justification before judging a creation's irreversible acts to ensure a fair and compassionate assessment of the circumstances that led to such actions. The initial reaction of anger and disgust towards the creation may be tempered by a deeper reflection on the complexities of the creature's existence, which could be shaped by factors such as isolation, rejection, and the absence of love or companionship. By understanding that the creation's actions may be consequences of its environment and treatment, the creator acknowledges their ethical obligations and considers their own role in the creation's plight. This approach underscores the importance of empathy and responsibility, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of accountability and the potential for redemption or reconciliation.",

The lush greenery of the flourishing vineyards on the gentle, sloping banks adds warmth and vitality to the scene, which contrasts with the stately ruins of ancient castles perched on the hills. This vivid juxtaposition highlights the differences between the enduring cycle of nature, represented by the vineyards, and the historical echoes, represented by the ruins, creating a captivating and varied landscape.",
    "Seasonal changes uplift spirits and inspire art by transforming the environment from the desolation of winter to the vibrant and lively atmosphere of spring and summer. As winter gives way to spring, the earth undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis, with barren landscapes blooming into colorful and fragrant scenes. This transformation is not only aesthetic but also spiritual, elevating the human spirit with an enchanting vigor. The cheerful elements of spring, such as birds singing, budding leaves, and genial warmth, invigorate both the body and the creative soul. Artists, inspired by this revitalization of nature, find their creativity reawakened and are driven by the desire to capture the beauty and vitality of the world around them. The change in seasons serves as a powerful muse, encouraging artists to delve into their work with renewed passion and enthusiasm, resulting in a harmonious blend of external beauty and internal inspiration.",

This mind is deeply connected to nature, not just superficially admiring its beauty but being consumed by it as if haunted by a passion. This connection is described as an appetite, a feeling, and a love that requires no external embellishment or intellectual contemplation to be appreciated. Wordsworth portrays a vivid imagination as one that finds profound meaning and connection in the natural world, sustaining its vitality and inspiration through this connection.",
    "The moon's glow heightens the terror of the figure at the window by casting eerie shadows that dance on the walls, creating an unsettling atmosphere. It illuminates the creature's monstrous visage, making its hideous appearance even more grotesque in the pale, ghostly light. The moonlight reveals the creature's fixed eyes, its grin, and its reaching hand, amplifying the horror and making the creature's presence feel both inescapable and otherworldly. The contrast between the serene glow of the moon and the horrifying reality of the creature's appearance adds a chilling layer to the observer's fear.",

    "The feelings that come from losing someone dear include a profound and multifaceted emotional experience. Initially, there is an overwhelming sense of disbelief and denial as the mind struggles to accept the permanence of the loss. This is followed by an intense bitterness of grief, which manifests as deep despair. There are often feelings of remorse and guilt, especially if one feels responsible for the circumstances surrounding the loss. The bereaved may experience a sense of culpability, leading to isolation and making joy seem distant and unattainable. Additionally, there is the pain of witnessing the suffering of others affected by the loss, which can amplify personal grief. Despite a shared experience of sorrow, each individual's journey through grief is solitary. There is a longing for consolation and hope for the deceased's peace, but true consolation for those left behind remains elusive. Over time, the sharpness of grief may dull, but the imprint of loss remains as a testament to the depth of love once shared.",
    "The men in Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's narrative are motivated to endure hardships alone by a profound sense of purpose and ambition. They are driven by the desire for glory and the aspiration to be hailed as benefactors of their species. They seek honor and recognition as brave souls who have faced and overcome danger and death, which fuels their courage and fortitude. The pursuit of knowledge and the control over humanity's elemental foes are also powerful motivators. Additionally, the quest for self-improvement and the challenge of testing one's limits, as well as the solitude that allows for reflection and personal growth, inspire them to persist through adversity.",
